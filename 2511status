Bug No: 18

In student’s profile page, for the height field, it is showing the value ‘nu’. While editing, it is allowing only two digits. What is the unit of this field (cm or feet?) Calories calculation includes height. So, in this case, not sure how it will work when it has value ‘nu’.

Fixed.

Testing Senario:

Add new student using csv upload, don’t assign any course. Login to mobile app using the student’s credential. The courses menu page is keep on showing ‘Loading…’ image. Even if we close and reopen the app, it is showing the image. I tried other logins which has courses assigned, but, it is showing the same image. Only the user id ‘param’ worked. Eugene also faced the same problem. I have asked him to use the id ‘param’.

Fixed.

I fixed the page loading issue. now  it won't show again. first screen will wait for two seconds and will load the content otherwise i will show no data message.

Bug No: 16

When the student is doing exercise, he should be able to play the video and see his heart rate values. But, with current implementation, we are not able to see both video and heartrate at the same time. I saw this couple of day back. Due to device scan issue, I couldn’t verify this again. Please test and fix it.


Fixed.

I updated the screen design and the video is also we added in the screen. Now User can able to saw the video along with user info.

Bug No 8 to 13

The course/workout/exercise status is incorrect. Please see the below screenshots.

Fixed

Screenshot1(ref:below email): CourseA is showing 25%. But, under the course, none of the workouts are in completed state.

Fixed

Screenshot1(ref:below email): course ‘t1’ has 2 days. But, it is showing as ‘ 1 days’

Fixed

Screenshot2 & 3(ref:below email): workout A1 is showing as ‘in progress’ but it has only one exercise which is ‘Completed’ state. So, the workout should be in ‘Completed’ state.

Need To Test

Screenshot2 & 4(ref:below email): workout A2 is showing as ‘Not Yet Started’ but it has only one exercise which is ‘Completed’ state. So, the workout should be in ‘Completed’ state.

Need To Test

When I mark the exercise as complete is workout A1, it automatically marked the exercise as complete in workout A2 as well. Impact: If we assign same exercise/workout to multiple courses/students, marking the exercise as completed for one student/workout/course will reflect in other students/courses.

Fixed.
